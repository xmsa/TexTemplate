I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on Machine Learning and Graph Processing, particularly within pharmaceutical applications. I commenced my programming journey in 2016 with C++ and C\#, subsequently attaining professional proficiency in Python. I possess practical experience in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and large language models (LLMs), complemented by an intermediate proficiency in prompt engineering. Through the application of FastAPI, Git, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines within an MLOps framework, I have successfully overseen the development and deployment lifecycle of machine learning models. Furthermore, I demonstrate strong capabilities in data visualization and analysis utilizing a range of tools. I am committed to contributing to innovative, data-centric projects in the domain of artificial intelligence.
