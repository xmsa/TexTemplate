I am a master's student specializing in Computer Science with a focus on Computational Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence. My journey in programming began in 2016, where I initiated my exploration with Python and C\#. Over time, I have honed my expertise in these languages, while also gaining introductory familiarity with R, C++, and Julia.

Currently, I am actively engaged in advanced studies, particularly in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Concurrently, I am deeply immersed in researching Drug Repositioning, seeking to broaden my understanding and contribute to this evolving field.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have cultivated skills in database management, web scraping, and Linux administration. Proficient in version control systems like Git, I am adept at collaborating on projects and ensuring version control integrity.

With my diverse skill set and ongoing dedication to learning, I strive to deliver exceptional performance and drive success in every project I undertake.
